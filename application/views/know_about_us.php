                                <br><br>
His blue shivering lips are filled with desperate please for help. Sounds familiar? Almost all of us have encountered such a pitiful sight that leaves us filled with utter sadness and rue.
<br><br>
All of us must have taken action once in a while,Contributing money in the name of kindness to Contribution sites. But do we have any answer to what happens with this heartfelt contribution of ours?
<br><br>
We all have this clueless moment, where we are left in the dark . But due to lack of a method to help them we continue on our way with our hearts laden heavy with despair."</p>

Once the order reaches the Child care home, a delivery confirmation and update is shared at the very moment.<br><br> All our transactions are publicly visible to users anytime, ensuring trust and transparency.</p>
